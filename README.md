## Why Scatterplots?

Scatterplots are chosen for their effectiveness in displaying the relationship between two variables. In the context of this project, scatterplots are employed to showcase the correlation between different player statistics, such as points scored, assists, and rebounds per game. This visual representation allows users to identify trends, outliers, and patterns, providing a deeper understanding of player performance over time.
